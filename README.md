# xtract
This bash script makes it simple to extract all the files needed for SlackBuilds.
After it is run there is just a file with slackbuilds, source, and other needed things.

# Note
Works only on the regular slackbuilds. What regular means here is a source compressed source file and compressed SlackBuild file.
